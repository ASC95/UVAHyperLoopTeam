Relevant Information from “Hyperloop Rules and Requirements” and “Specifications” documents-Need to know power consumption by sub system-We should choose efficient sensors, chips, etc.-Are we responsible for the pod navigation, levitation, propulsion, and breaking systems?-Must have a working GUI that can send commands to the train-Need telemetry stream-Remote control emergency stop capability-Electronics must be robust to vibration-We are going to need batteries to run the sensors, cpu, etc.-There’s a charging station in the waiting area for the pod-Bandwidth shouldn’t exceed 20Mbps from the cable on the tunnel ceiling-Latency should be <10ms-Network access should be constant, but if the network disappears, the pod should enter a “safe state”-We could use our own communications system other than the Ethernet…-They are going to give us a network access panel which we will have to incorporate at the staging area-We can use our own antenna for the N.A.P-There is tape along the inside of the tube to indicate the pod’s position-Braking system must be redundant
